Finally you can have terminalcolors (http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/11/01/customising-colours-in-leopard-terminal) fully working on Snow Leopard.

I merged evanphx's Snow Leopard fixes with silverity's 64bit fixes. With this newer bundle and the "newest SIMBL (http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) that works on Snow Leopard, you don't need to open the Terminal in 32bit mode any more.

1. If you don't have SIMBL, Install it from here: http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php
2. copy the bundle (TerminalColours-SL-64bit.bundle) into ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins
3. restart terminal.app
4. You'll now see the colors under Terminal>settings>text>more


ps: I'm a total xcode/objective-c newb, so let me know if I did anything wrong :)
